The most severe issue identified in the project is a memory-related warning. This issue could potentially impact the performance of the software, especially in environments with limited memory resources.\n\nThe memory issue is related to the 'max_tokens' parameter being set to a high value (4000). This could lead to high memory usage if the model generates a large number of tokens. The issue was identified in the `main.py` file, which is the only source file in the project. Therefore, 100% of the project files have issues of severity 7 or higher.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe memory issue could potentially impact customers by causing the software to consume more memory than expected, which could lead to performance degradation or even crashes in memory-constrained environments. This could negatively affect the user experience and potentially lead to data loss or corruption.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe overall health of the source code is concerning due to the memory issue identified. However, as the project consists of a single file, it should be relatively straightforward to address this issue.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe root cause of the memory issue appears to be a lack of developer education regarding the potential memory impact of setting the 'max_tokens' parameter to a high value. \n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n1. Reduce the 'max_tokens' parameter if possible, or ensure sufficient memory is available.\n2. Provide additional training or resources to the development team regarding the potential memory impact of various parameters and settings.\n3. Implement a code review process to catch potential issues before they make it into the production code.\n\n### Highlights\n\n- The most severe issue identified is a memory-related warning in the `main.py` file.\n- This issue could potentially impact the performance of the software, especially in environments with limited memory resources.\n- The root cause of the issue appears to be a lack of developer education regarding the potential memory impact of setting the 'max_tokens' parameter to a high value.\n- Recommended actions include reducing the 'max_tokens' parameter, providing additional training to the development team, and implementing a code review process.",
